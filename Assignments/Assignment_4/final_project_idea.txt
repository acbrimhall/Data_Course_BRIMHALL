I would like to examine the relationship between ADHD and and EEG recordings.

There are several possible data sets on Google's Dataset Search, including but not limited to:
	CHILDREN WITH ADHD SHOWN DIFFERENT ALPHA, BETA AND SMR EEG BANDS DURING HABIL MOTOR TASKS WITH HIGH ATTENTION DEMAND
	FOCUS: EEG brain recordings of ADHD and non-ADHD individuals during gameplay
	EEG data for ADHD / Control children
	Data_Sheet_1_Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Discriminate Adult ADHD From Healthy Individuals on the Basis of Event-Related Spectral EEG.PDF
	A Dataset of EEG Signals from Adults with ADHD and Healthy Controls: Resting State, Cognitive function, and Sound Listening Paradigm

I would like to compile some of this data into one larger data set to examine the relationship between ADHD and "abnormalities" in EEG recordings when compared to a control.

In particular the data set found at this web address which seems like it would be a good fit for potential use in my final project.

There is also data on this site, but I was unable to access it without a membership unfortunatley. It may be a good source for additional data if neccessary.

I did download data from the site below, but the files seemed to be too large for my computer to load and were in ther .mat format.
